Find all the solutions for me please!
=====================================

I decided to code a program that searches for all the solutions to these two puzzles (google for "oldchap.games"):
- "Coba", written by Antonin Boccara and Michel Verdu, published by Oldchap
- "By Odin", written by Antonin Boccara and Michel Verdu, published by Oldchap

I first used the help of ChatGPT, but of course, as in all cases where one must do something advanced, it served only as an assistant, and I had to finish all the parts of the code that were truly complicated.

"I have completed the full implementation, and now my computer is running to search for all possibilities with 7 white dice from the first puzzle and 7 white dice from the second puzzle.

I will add all the solutions that have been found as comments in the code. Next, there's something more complex, which is to add all the black dice and all combinations of all the black dice. For now, I will stop here, and if someone wants to pick up the code and finish with all the combinations of all the black dice, it would be great to evolve the project and also have all the combinations with all the black dice.

Coba

The legend tells that one day a human will come to the realm of Asgard and play alongside the gods… Will you be that hero?

In 'Par Odin', you take on the role of a human warrior who has come to accomplish 50 challenges in order to sit at the table of the gods. In this single-player, narrative, and evolving game, you will gradually, through the challenges, discover the mechanical richness of the game and the universe of Norse mythology.
