Objective
=========

I have decided to implement the game "By Odin" written by Antonin Boccara and
Michel Verdu, published by Oldchap.

It's a thrilling game in which you need to solve puzzles for one player.

Development
===========

With substantial assistance from ChatGPT, I have managed to develop all the
foundations of the game in pure C. Of course, as with all instances where you
must use ChatGPT for programming, it can only lay the groundwork and cannot
venture far; the advanced programming will be up to you to complete. I thus
began to develop the code with its help, then I implemented all the problems
and ensured that all the solutions I found corresponded to the proposed
solutions in the game. Everything worked perfectly except for puzzle number
43, which is unsolvable. I strongly recommend purchasing this game as it is
very important to continue promoting small puzzles like this one.
