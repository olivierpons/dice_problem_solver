Objective
=========

I decided to code a program that searches for all the solutions to these 
two puzzles (google for "oldchap.games"):
 
- "Coba", written by Antonin Boccara and Michel Verdu, published by Oldchap
- "By Odin", written by Antonin Boccara and Michel Verdu, published by Oldchap

I first used the help of ChatGPT, but of course, as in all cases where one 
must do something advanced, it served only as an assistant, and I had to 
finish all the parts of the code that were truly complicated.

Official description of "Coba"
==============================

The time has come for you to undertake the quest for the stones of Coba... 
Will you be up to the challenge?

In 'The Stones of Coba,' you will need to solve 50 logical challenges to restore 
balance within the Mayan society. In this solo, narrative, and evolving game, 
you will discover the game's rich mechanics through various challenges.

A very small box for hours of gameplay!

Official description of "By Odin"
=================================

<img src="img-by-odin-dice.png" alt="By Odin" width="300" style="max-width: 300px; height: auto;">

The legend tells that one day a human will come to the realm of Asgard and play 
alongside the godsâ€¦ Will you be that hero?

In 'Par Odin', you take on the role of a human warrior who has come to 
accomplish 50 challenges in order to sit at the table of the gods. 
In this single-player, narrative, and evolving game, you will gradually, 
through the challenges, discover the mechanical richness of the game and 
the universe of Norse mythology.

A very small box for hours of gameplay!

Development
===========

"I have completed the full implementation, and now my computer is running to 
search for all possibilities with 7 white dice from the first puzzle and
7 white dice from the second puzzle.

I will add all the solutions that have been found as comments in the code.
Next, there's something more complex, which is to add all the black dice and 
all combinations of all the black dice. For now, I will stop here, and if 
someone wants to pick up the code and finish with all the combinations of all 
the black dice, it would be great to evolve the project and also have all the 
combinations with all the black dice.
